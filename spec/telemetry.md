# Telemetry Spec (Semantics Observatory Stub)

To support emergent semiotics, log the following fields when traversals occur:
- `rel` and `relVersion`
- `actionType`
- `affordance_id`
- `outcome` summary
- `context_id`
- `timestamp`

This is a stub and will evolve into a Semantics Observatory specification.
