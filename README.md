# Context Graph Protocol (MVP Scaffold)

This repository is a scaffold for the Context Graph Protocol (CGP) and related specs.
It is intended to keep the data contracts and architecture constraints explicit before
implementation.

## Repository Layout
- `spec/` — canonical contracts and protocol specs
- `docs/` — architecture guides and pillars
- `examples/` — golden-path payloads and negative cases
- `tests/` — placeholder for negative tests

## Status
Specs-first scaffold. No runtime implementation yet.
