# Hypermedia Principles

## Non-Negotiable Rules
- No global tool list is exposed to agents.
- Agents must consume broker-provided affordances only.
- Affordances are discovered at runtime.

## Implications
- Clients must treat affordances as the sole action surface.
- Context Graphs are the authoritative state representation for actions.
