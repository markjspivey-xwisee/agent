# Policy

Policy gates whether an affordance is emitted and whether a traversal is allowed.

## Layers
1. **Deontic policy**: permit/deny/duty rules for affordance existence.
2. **Outcome constraints**: risk thresholds based on causal predictions.

## MVP
- Allowlist of trusted issuers.
- Required schema for each affordance.
